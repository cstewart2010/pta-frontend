# Comment
## JSDoc
All publically assessible program units will be contain a JSDoc, a block comment preceding its declaration that describes the unit's intented use and functionality. This will make code easier to read and allow for better autocomplete functionality for editors that support JSDocs like Visual Studio Code.

## Inline Comments
Inline comments should be used sparingly. Identifiers and JSDocs gives the coders most, if not all, of the information need for understanding the program unit. However, one may add an inline comment to add clarity to an otherwise-complex section of a subroutine. You will know when you're in a situation like this.

## Block Comments
Block comments will **never** be committed to source control. Only use them to temporarily remove and change large sections of code will debugging prospective changes.
